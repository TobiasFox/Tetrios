# Tetrios  

This project is a clone of the game Tetris, which I implemented with a friend in Java.  
To run the jar file please have Java JRE at least version 1.8 (8u20) installed.

**Please note: to see icons in the game please have the folder "Bilder" on the same level as the file Tetrios_1.2.jar.**
